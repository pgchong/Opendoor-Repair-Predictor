Inspections and repair estimation are a part of the current home seller process. Sellers may request an offer from Opendoor. Upon offer acceptance, an Opendoor estimator visits the home to scope common repairs needed before listing.
The common scopes are then charged to the seller as a requirement for the home sale. For example, if the estimator identifies $1500 in common scopes, the seller can either decide to accept the $1500 charge and complete the sale or withdraw from the process. For every $150 in repair charge we can expect to have a 1% withdrawal rate.
We want to manage our withdrawal rates because every home Opendoor acquires translates to $5000 in profit on average. One option is to eliminate inspections and tell sellers how much repairs will likely cost as soon as they request an offer. We think this added convenience may reduce withdrawal rates by 5 percentage points.
Please analyze the attached data to determine whether we should provide an estimate of
 repairs at time of offer. If we should not, please explain why. a roadmap to do so with the following milestones:
- V0 solution (1 Month)
- V1 solution (1Quarter)
